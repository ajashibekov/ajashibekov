# A bit of history
I've started coding at an early age, when all of the tech industry started booming. My first encounter with programming was an extracurricular course in my middle school that 
I signed up for in grade 5. And that course was... C++ - not too beginner-friendly! Unfortunately, the course was cancelled after some time, but I continued my coding journey 
with Visual Basic. It was a great tool which enabled me to play around with both UI (VB had a drag-and-drop interface for building UI) and backend. That's when I built my first
apps, most notably, a trivia game. Fast forward a few years, I began studying Computer Science in one of Hong Kong's universities. After graduation, I've worked in a financial
firm for a while, and now looking for new challenges.
